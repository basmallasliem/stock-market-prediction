# stock-market-prediction
this project aims to predict a stock market data to asses the risk for the egyptian companies.

Data collection
we collected the data of 5 companies from (investing.com) website, the data contains (price, open, high, low, volume) columns that represent stock market data.

Data preprocessing
this step for cleaning the data by handling the missing values, duplicate data, and outliers

Exploratory data analysis
to make a summary statistics for the data to make a valuable insights

Data analysis and visualization
Data visualization helps us to display the data in meaningful insights that make sense.
we visualize our data to see highest prices at the companies, closing prices at each company, largest daily returm for each company, and compare the expected return and risk for all the companies.

Prediction 
use LSTM to make accurate predictions, by splitting data into 80% training data and 20% test data.
then visualize the results of the actual value vs. predicted value.

Model evaluation
using RMSE to evaluate the model, the resulat was 3.582, it indicates the average magnitude of 
prediction error in our model.
